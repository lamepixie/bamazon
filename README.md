# Bamazon Store
*UCF Coding Bootcamp Assignment Week 12*

The purpose of this assignment was to create an *Amazon Like* storefront using MySQL and Node.js
This assignment allows users to select items they wish to buy, and the desired quantity.  After the user has made their selection and quantity for purchase, the quantity is subtracted from the gross total of that item *in supply* from the store.
